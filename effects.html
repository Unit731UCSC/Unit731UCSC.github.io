    <h5>The Promise and Perils of Unit 731 Data to Advance COVID-19 Research</h5>
    <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;"><img href="images/covid.jpg"></div>
    <p>By Adrian Garcia</p>
    <p class = "analysis">“The promise and perils of Unit 731 data to advance COVID-19 research” is a research article by Zhaohui,
       McDonnell, Cheshmehzangi, Abbas, Li, and Cai, published by BMJ Global Health, that analyzes the potential 
       use of the data gathered by Unit 731 during WWII. Zhaohui et al. argue that Unit 731 data could help epidemiologists
        better understand pandemics similar to COVID-19’s scale as, although cruel, a core aim of Unit 731 biological warfare 
        experiments was to determine human-pathogen interactions at various levels. <a href="sources.html#:~:text=Su%20Zhaohui%2C%20Dean%20McDonnell%2C%20Ali%20Cheshmehzangi%2C%20Jaffar%20Abbas%2C%20Xiaoshan%20Li%2C%20and%20Yuyang%20Cai.%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Promise%20and%20Perils%20of%20Unit%20731%20Data%20to%20Advance%20COVID%2D19%20Research.%E2%80%9D%20BMJ%20Global%20Health%206%2C%20no.%205%20(April%2017%2C%202021).%20https%3A//doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh%2D2020%2D004772.%20Page%201."><sup>[1] </sup></a>
         Additionally, because Unit 731 data has not 
        been fully released to the medical community, Zhaohui et al. speculate that Unit 731 data could be the most exhaustive medical
         datasets on human-pathogen interactions.<a href="sources.html#:~:text=%5B2%5D-,Ibid%20page%202.,-%5B3%5D%20Ibid"><sup>[2] </sup></a>
      However, Zhaohui et al. also acknowledge the inherent ethical dilemma of leveraging data gathered by Unit 731. 
       As stated in the source, there are mainly 3 schools of thought,
      </p>
      <p class = "analysis" style="text-align: center;">
      “(1) using the data is not permissible, [because] tortured and killed victims would
      be wronged anew by the use of this data; (2) using the data is not permissible, [because only] 
      some insights could be gained from Unit 731 experiments; and (3) using the data is not permissible
       under certain circumstances, for instance, the Unit 731 data will only be used with all ethical standards 
       sufficiently met, and under the condition that there are no alternative ethical ways to obtain similar data”.<a href="sources.html#:~:text=%5B3%5D-,Ibid,-Gold%2C%20Hal."><sup>[3] </sup></a>
       </p>
       <p class = "analysis">
      Zhaohui et al. conclude their paper by illustrating their agenda by stating that it is undeniable that the 
      data collected by Unit 731 has the potential to advance research on the COVID-19 pandemic and should be released
       and used. However, the ethical dilemmas aforementioned should and must be discussed further before any exploration
        is considered. Additionally, if found to be beneficial, whether the actions of Unit 731 should be forgiven
        (thus altering the collective memory of Unit 731) should be subsequently analyzed by the public.

      <h5>Education/How Unit 731 is Covered</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg2" style="height:300px;"></div>
      <p>by Cheyenne Robinson-Greer</p>

      <p class = "analysis">Unit 731 receives little to no coverage in secondary school curriculum, the main reason being a lack of knowledge about the unit.
         This is due to the lack of awareness of the unit among teachers and the general public as a whole. Education of Unit 731 also faces the 
         challenge of justifying its inclusion in school curriculums. Curriculums covering Unit 731have to adhere to restrictive state standards and
         prove that the content is age appropriate as well as prove that there are enough materials available to teach about the subject in the first place.
      </p>

      <p class = "analysis">
        Coverage surrounding the atrocities committed by the Japanese is often vague in American textbooks, and the level of brutality is glossed over:
      </p>
      <ul class = "analysis">
        <li>Elizabeth Ellis's edited volume, World History: The Modern Era, states: "Japanese invaders
           treated Chinese…and other conquered people with great brutality, killing and torturing civilians throughout East and Southeast Asia."<a href="sources.html#:~:text=%5B1%5D%20Prentice%20Hall%20World%20History%3A%20The%20Modern%20Era.%20Pearson/Prentice%20Hall%2C%202007."><sup>[1] </sup></a></li>
        <li>"Japanese troops often treated soldiers and civilians alike with great brutality."<a href="sources.html#:~:text=World%20History%3A%20The%20Human%20Journey%20(Chicago%2C%20IL%3A%20Holt%2C%20Rajehart%2C%20and%20Winston%2C2003)%2C%20809."><sup>[2] </sup></a></li>
        <li>"Japanese rule proved to be as harsh as that of former colonial powers."<a href="sources.html#:~:text=Asia%20and%20the%20Pacific%2C%20Prentice%20Hall%20World%20Explorer%20Series%20(Needham%2C%20MA%3A%20Prentice%20Hall%2C%202003)%2C%2090."><sup>[3] </sup></a></li>
      </ul>

      <p class = "analysis">
        The lack of education about Unit 731 is also due to the fact that it would have to meet state requirements that decide what content is taught in 
        schools, and those standards are often very rigid in what they allow taught in schools:
      </p>
      <ul class = "analysis">
        <li>In 2002, the state of Ohio adopted 139 mandated standards for high school history textbooks, which drastically reduced the flexibility 
          authors were given in choosing the topics they chose to write about. One of the standards that would have affected the inclusion of Unit 731 
          stated: "Analyze the results of political, economic, and social oppression and the violation of human rights including: a) The exploitation of 
          indigenous peoples; and b) The Holocaust and other acts of genocide, including those that have occurred in Armenia, Rwanda, Bosnia, and Iraq."<a href="sources.html#:~:text=%5B4%5D%20Ohio%20Department%20of%20Education%2C%20*Ohio%27s%202002%20Academic%20Content%20Standards%20in%20Social%20Studies%3A%20Academic%20Content%20Standards%3A%20K%2D12%20Social%20Studies%22%20(Columbus%2C%20OH%3A%20Ohio%20Department%20of%20Education%2C%202002)%2C%2060."><sup>[4] </sup></a>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class = "analysis">
        The content standards specifically in California and Texas have drastic impacts on the national market for textbooks, and therefore 
        have a lot of influence on what is taught to students nationwide. Due to the standards being specific in what content is covered, that often 
        doesn’t allow time for teachers to acknowledge other atrocities that didn’t have a major social impact in the minds of the average American. 
        The content that is chosen to be taught in textbooks often has a focus on how history relates to America, and Unit 731 may have trouble fitting 
        into the curriculum with a vast amount of the victims not being American. The curriculum about atrocities also has to factor in how the violent 
        content will be taught to young children.
      </p>
      <ul class = "analysis">
        <li>The textbook industry is dominated by three major publishing companies Pearson Education Inc., Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, and McGraw-Hill 
          which together serve about 80 percent of the U.S. K-12 textbook market, with California and Texas having the largest and second-largest market 
          share out of all states.<a href="sources.html#:~:text=%5B5%5D%20%22The%20Great%20Textbook%20Wars%2C%22%20The%20Week%2C%2024%20September%202010%2C%20http%3A//theweek.com/article/index/207395/the%2Dgreat%2Dtextbook%2Dwars."><sup>[5] </sup></a>
        </li>
        <li>In the state of California, the standards that relate to education surrounding topics like Unit 731 is Standard 10.8.1, which requires 
          students to "Compare the German, Italian, and Japanese drives for empire in the 1930s, including the 1937 Rape of Nanking, other atrocities in 
          China (emphasis added on the Stalin-Hitler Pact of 1939.) The second Standard 10.8.6, requires students to be able to "Discuss the human costs 
          of the war, with particular attention to the civilian and military losses in Russia, Germany, Britain, the United States, China, and Japan," 
          Though no specificities are given on what "other atrocities in China" might entail, these standards do allow for education surrounding Unit 731.<a href="sources.html#:~:text=%5B6%5D%20California%20State%20Board%20of%20Education%2C%20History%2DSocial%20Science%20Content%20Standards%20for%20California%20Public%20Schools%2C%20Kindergarten%20Through%20Grade%20Twelve%22%20(Sacramento%2C%20CA%3A%20California%20Department%20of%20Education%20Press%2C%202000)%2C%2045."><sup>[6] </sup></a>

        <li>In Texas, the standards are more particular about what should be taught. Standard 113.41 c-7-E states: "analyze major military events of World 
          War II, including the Battle of Midway, the U.S. military advancement through the Pacific Islands, the Bataan Death March, the invasion of

        Another challenge facing education on Unit 731 is the general lack of available information available about the subject, with studies conducted 
        at Unit 731 not appearing until the 1980s after a box of documents was discovered in a Japanese second-hand bookstore.
      </p>
      <ul class = "analysis">
        <li>Many of the original documents have not been translated from Japanese, and primary materials in English are not widely available.<a href="sources.html#:~:text=%5B8%5D%20%22Japan%27s%20Germ%20Warfare%3A%20The%20U.S.%20Cover%2DUp%20of%20a%20War%20Crime%2C%22%20Bulletin%20of%20Concerned%20Asian%20Scholars%2012%2C%20no.%204%20(Oct%C3%B6ber%2DDecember%201980)%3A%202%2D17%3B%20%E2%80%9CA%20Hidden%20Chapter%20in%20History%2C%22%20Bulletin%20of%20the%20Atomic%20Scientists%2037%2C%20no.%208%20(October%201981)%3A%2043%2D53."><sup>[8] </sup></a>

        </li>
        <li>Some of the original documents remain classified even today, due to the motivations of the United States government of keeping the information 
          discovered secret. Due to The Cold War, the United States had the goal of keeping any information, that would be advantageous such as Japanese 
          WWII data and the doctors and scientists who produced them, away from the USSR.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class = "analysis">Overall knowledge surrounding past atrocities like Unit 731 are getting more recognition, and with this awareness comes the issue of what should 
        be included in the curriculum of public schools that have to meet state standards. These standards restrict what is taught, especially regarding 
        foreign nations, leading to even more of a bias towards history that is from or directly affects Americans. Controversial topics such as Unit 731 
        that take place in an environment that doesn’t have as direct of an impact as other subjects on America also influence if the subject is deemed to
        be necessary for students to know.</p>

      <h5>Unit 731 and Entertainment</h5>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4nPxik59oE"><div class="fakeimg3" style="height:300px;"></div></a>
      <p>By Adrien Jones</p>
      <p class = "analysis">Retelling the stories of Unit 731 is not just relegated to education, but also entertainment. “The Horrors of Unit 731” is 
        a youtube video uploaded by the channel the Infographics Show. With a runtime of just about 8 minutes, the video hyper-focuses on the horrific 
        experiments conducted by Unit 731. At odds with the heavy subject matter, the video is narrated by a lively and enthusiastic voice over and uses 
        simplistic, childish animations to illustrate the narration and Unit 731 experiments. The language used is simplistic and nonspecific, making the 
        video very accessible to non academic audiences. The only sources the cites are the Guardian, the New York Times, and Unit731.org.<a href="sources.html#:~:text=%5B1%5D-,The%20Infographics%20Show%2C%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Horrors%20of%20Unit%20731%E2%80%9D%20Youtube%20Video%2C%208%3A10%2C%20April%2025%2C%202019%2C%20https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DD4nPxik59oE,-%5B2%5D%20Ibid"><sup>[1] </sup></a> 
        While the 
        juxtaposition of such grave subject matter to such light hearted visuals is alarming, they play an important role in how this video is meant to be 
        understood. First and foremost, “The Horrors of Unit 731” is entertainment, and meant to rake in as many views as possible. 
        </p>
        <p class = "analysis">The simplistic and colorful animation style appeals to adults and kids alike, and even though the video focuses on the 
          experiments conducted by the Unit, the illustrations of these experiments aren’t graphic or explicit. When victims are described as having 
          frostbite, their arms are simply colored blue, or have ice cubes drawn around their hands, and they shiver cartoonishly. All the victims are 
          the same generic male model with the same timid, cartoonish facial expressions, and all the Japanese soldiers are the same model as well.<a href="sources.html#:~:text=%5B2%5D-,Ibid,-%5B3%5D%20Sunjung"><sup>[2] </sup></a>
           The 
          effect of this artistic decision is that viewing the video is palatable, and the viewer is able to stomach and even find humor in the antics 
          of the characters on screen despite the horrible things the narrator describes. 
          </p>
          <p class = "analysis">The focus on the more dramatic aspects of the history of Unit 731 also reveals the intent to entertain. 
            A majority of the video is spent discussing the different categories of experiments that where conducted, focusing on all the scary details. 
            But these details are also the most shocking, and they keep the viewer hooked. Little attention is paid to the actual repercussions of Unit 731, 
            the politics and social factors behind being able to do such things to other human beings, or even the motivations behind these experiments 
            besides improving warfare.
            </p>
            <p class = "analysis">Currently sitting at 2.1 million views and 53,000 likes, “The Horrors of Unit 731” has certainly drawn a global audience. 
              Commenters hail the video for educating them about the little known unit, and others state their sympathy for the victims. One of the top 
              comments on the video states “I am Korean and I couldn't understand why still the Japanese government denies this unit. I think Japan should 
              teach this dark history to its citizens at least.”<a href="sources.html#:~:text=Sunjung%20Kim%2C%202020%2C%20%E2%80%9Ccomment%20on%2C%E2%80%9D%20The%20Infographics%20Show%2C%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Horrors%20of%20Unit%20731%E2%80%9D%20Youtube%20Video%2C%208%3A10%2C%20April%2025%2C%202019%2C%20https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DD4nPxik59oE"><sup>[3] </sup></a> 
              A repeated trend is commenters criticizing Japan for hiding information about Unit 731. 
              These comments show how the Infographics show has framed the memory of Unit 731: by the actions committed, by its shock value.
              </p>
              <p class = "analysis">The Infographics show is a Youtube Channel and company with 11.7 million subscribers and promotes 
                itself as an edutainment channel, stating “Facts are fun, but most are presented in boring and badly edited videos. The Infographics
                 Show focuses on making animated motion infographic videos, made in a fun and entertaining way.” <a href="sources.html#:~:text=The%20Infographics%20Show.%20%E2%80%9CAbout.%E2%80%9D%20YouTube.%20https%3A//www.youtube.com/c/TheInfographicsShowOFFICIAL/about"><sup>[4] </sup></a>
                 Finding any information about the 
                 Infographics Show channel is nearly impossible, but a dated Forbes article states that Andrej Preston is Motion Graphics Designer & 
                 Producer. Beyond Preston however, no information is to be found, regarding who Preston is, how research for videos is conducted, what 
                 their fact checking process is or what their true sources are. But these details have little impact on the videos reception with the 
                 public, the viewers are hooked and the commenters are able to leave their own 2 cents about the vague history of Unit 731. However, due to 
                 the way the video handles the topic, its relatively recent upload date, and the staggering amount of views the video has, “The Horrors of 
                 Unit 731” provides an interesting perspective on the current way Unit 731 is being remembered, as entertainment instead of history.
