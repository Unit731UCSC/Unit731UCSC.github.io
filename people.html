      <p>A video review of the life of Ishii Shirō</p>
      <p class = "analysis">Ishii Shirō & the Founding of Unit 731 is a video essay on the life of Ishii Shirō, and what
         events eventually lead to the creation of Unit 731, and his placement as the man in charge of it.
          The video was created on December 10, 2019 by Michael, the owner of the youtube channel it was published on, The Historian’s Craft.<a href="https://unit731ucsc.github.io/sources.html#:~:text=%5B1%5D%20Michael.%20%E2%80%9CIshii%20Shir%C5%8D%20%26%20the%20Founding%20of%20Unit%20731.%E2%80%9D%20YouTube%2C%20YouTube%2C%2010%20Dec.%202019%2C%20https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DxOdiQU5gNRc."><sup>[1] </sup></a>
           Michael graduated from the State University of New York with a B.A in History and a minor in Anthropology, and has since created The
            Historian's Craft to permit easier access to academic research for the general public.<a href="https://unit731ucsc.github.io/sources.html#:~:text=%5B2%5D%20Michael.%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Historian%27s%20Craft%20Is%20Creating%20Videos%20and%20Infographics%20about%20History%20and%20Archaeology.%E2%80%9D%20Patreon%2C%202017%2C%20https%3A//www.patreon.com/thehistorianscraft."><sup>[2] </sup></a>
             He believes that “History is for everyone, not just 
            those who can afford college”. <a href="https://unit731ucsc.github.io/sources.html#:~:text=%5B3%5D%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Historian%27s%20Craft%20Intro%20Page.%E2%80%9D%20YouTube%2C%20YouTube%2C%202021%2C%20https%3A//www.youtube.com/c/TheFallofRome."><sup>[3] </sup></a>It is important to note that as the publisher and writer of this work, Michael’s work must be carefully considered
             when using it as a source. That being said, throughout his video essay, Michael makes sure to verbally announce when a source is being referred to.
              He also lists all of his sources, both primary and secondary, in the description of the video. In his video, Michael tends to stick straight to the
               sources he refers to, summing them up as one cohesive story, but rarely adding his own thoughts or speculation. He is even sure to announce whenever 
               he moves from sources to speculation to fill in the gaps, and seems intent on maintaining the integrity of the sources he uses. Overall,
         the main goal of Ishii Shirō & the Founding of Unit 731 seems to line up with Michael’s goal of allowing for easier access to academic resources. </p>
