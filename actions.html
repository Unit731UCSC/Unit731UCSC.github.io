        <p>Film Exposing Japanese atrocities</p>
        <p>The  “Unit 731:Nightmare in Manchuria” film exposes the atrocities that occurred
           during Japan’s biochemical testing on innocent civilians in China. Through the 
           film, the audience is able to learn how Unit 731’s development was made possible 
           with support from the Japanese Emperor Hirohito and under the command of Shirō 
           Ishii. “Unit 731:Nightmare in Manchuria” provides a close analysis and look into 
           how the Japanese government was able to successfully carry out research, including
            its tactics in choosing the location of the laboratory to be Harbin, a location 
            in China invaded by Japan that was remote, yet accessible enough for this top 
            secret laboratory to develop its research. Additionally, such research was also 
            made possible with the dehumanization of its victims. This evidence of 
            dehumanization is shared in “Unit 731:Nightmare in Manchuria” by Fang Zheng-Yu, 
            a Chinese slave laborer at Unit 731 who gives his account of what he witnessed 
            while people were taken on a one way train ride to Unit 731. Fang Zheng-Yu 
            states, “I didn’t know what was happening. Then, I noticed arms sticking out,
             and heads moving and blood coming out. And then, the Japanese yelled ‘logs’, 
             so I knew those were people” (13:14-13:27). The victims were referred to as 
             logs due to the Japanese treating them as not humans, but pieces of wood that 
             could be cut up and then burned without hesitation. This dehumanization of 
             humans in times of war is what is often described as being the way that these 
             atrocities of war are possible.

          The “Unit 731:Nightmare in Manchuria” film exhibits a close look at the atrocities
           victims inside the laboratory had to undergo including bombings, frostbite, exposure 
           to diseases, and live vivisection. Additionally, “Unit 731:Nightmare in Manchuria” 
           exposes how victims were sprayed with diseases and plagues in cities and villages 
           outside the laboratory. To support this, the “Unit 731:Nightmare in Manchuria” film 
           bases its use of evidence on the research of Professor Sheldon H. Harris who was a 
           historian and professor of history at California State University, Northridge. 
           Sheldon H. Harris was also the author of Factories of Death: Japanese Biological
            Warfare, 1932-45 and the American Cover-Up which gives the film high credibility as it
             is based on extensive fieldwork by a historian who has also written a lot of scholarly 
             articles, addressed numerous conferences, and spoke about the Japanese experiments in 
             various countries. Apart from the exhibition of research from Sheldon H. Harris, the 
             “Unit 731:Nightmare in Manchuria” film also supports its arguments with the use of 
             primary and secondary sources. There are a wide variety of photographs, notes from the
              laboratory, videos and interviews shown throughout the film. Some of these first hand 
              accounts included are by people like Yoshio Shinozuka who was a medical researcher at
               Unit 73, Huan Yuefeng who was a Chinese survivor of Unit 731’s field testing, and
                Fang Zheng-Yu who was a Chinese slave laborer at Unit 731. Secondhand accounts are 
                also included from people like Li Angu who is a relative of Unit 731 victims and
                 Yoshiaki Yoshimi who is a professor of modern history at Chuo University in Tokyo,
                  Japan. By including a wide variety of accounts and evidence, “Unit 731:Nightmare 
                  in Manchuria” provides a very well rounded and credible account of what happened 
                  in Unit 731. 
                  It is important to note that the “Unit 731:Nightmare in Manchuria” film 
                  was aired on July 7, 2001 on the fourth season of a show called “World 
                  Justice” on the History Channel. It is reasonable that “Unit 731:Nightmare 
                  in Manchuria” was aired on a show involving the theme of justice as the 
                  film ends with explicit messages involving visions for justice. 
                  “Unit 731:Nightmare in Manchuria” stresses how Japan keeps denying the war
                   atrocities and includes what people think the Japanese government should 
                   do today including the seeking of justice for victims, the persecution of
                    those who committed such atrocities, the public acknowledgement from the
                     Japanese government of what they have done, and monetary compensation 
                     for victims. The “Unit 731:Nightmare in Manchuria” also shares how it 
                     is not enough to only condemn Japan, but stresses how the United States
                      must also face their involvement in these atrocities and their 
                      involvement in not allowing Japan to be prosecuted. It is important to
                       note that the film is produced by Lionsgate which is a 
                       Canadian-American company. “Unit 731:Nightmare in Manchuria” is also 
                       produced in the English language, so it appears the audience is mainly
                        Americans and people living in the United States. Additionally,
                         the film may be attempting to make people in the United States aware
                          of this event that occurred during World War Two and that their own
                           country had a part in.
